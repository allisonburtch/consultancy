We're [name]. We work with people. And ideas. And technology. But mainly people. 

# [name] is the *feeling you get when someone has your back* and *tells the truth*.

Weâ€™re a research lab for the future. We work with you to solve tricky problems, publish trends, help you meet your goals, and report on findings.

We help you align your mission and your product, your dream with reality, so that you can be fully grounded in your own integrity as you bravely build the future. 

Building something new is brave. Building something new that is an affront to the status quo is braver. Let's build the horizon together.
