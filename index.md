We're IRL Research Lab. We work with people. And ideas. And technology. But mainly people. 

Humanity is on the verge of many possible futures, all happening at the same time, to all of us. 

I'm not here to support you in how you *should* be, whatever that means. I'm here to hold space for your complicated tech/business/people problems with warmth, precision and integrity. 

Weâ€™re a research lab for the future. We will help you align your mission and your product, your dream with reality, so that you can be fully grounded in your own integrity as you bravely build the future. 

Building something new is brave. Let's build the horizon together.
