# We're called _Holding Your Horses_. 
# Because you want to go fast. 

### We're here to help you do that.

Startups start with a wild/terrible/genius/boring idea and the will to make it happen. You have a vision for a different world, how your product will help people.

I work with people. And ideas. But mainly people. I could say I work with startups, non profits, NGOs, but at the end of the day it's people making these companies happen. 

I will work with you to take your startup to the next level. 

It's increasingly important -- not only for thet future of the planet and humanity but for your business ietself -- to align your mission with you rproduct. Your customers want to buy something that feels good. Your employees don't want to work for someone shady. I'm not an ethicist. I believe in a productive future, that dreaming is important, and making the world a space for all of us is urgently important. 

I'm here to partner with you to solve the problems of future productions.
