### We believe that humanity is on the verge of many possible futures.

### We help teams of people build inspiring products.

### We thrive on the difficult and have the range to hold space for complicated projects. 

We align your mission and your product, your dream with reality, so that you can be fully grounded in your own integrity as you plan and build. 

## Here's how:

We **conduct research** to predict possible futures

We **analyze** your company’s product and mission alignment.

We **build tech roadmaps** to fix and maintain alignment.

## But mostly, we have your back, and tell the truth.

**And we’ve done this with [big ideas](/reviews) in the past:** drones for humanitarian work, on-device machine learning for recommendations, blockchain for journalism and privacy hardware far ahead of its time. 

**Building something new is brave. [Let's build](/services) the horizon together.**
