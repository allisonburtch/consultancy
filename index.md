We're IRL Research Lab. We work with people. And ideas. And technology. But mainly people. 

### Humanity is on the verge of many possible futures, all happening at the same time, to all of us. 

We love doing the research to predict possible futures. 
We bring clarity that saves your organization time, energy and resources. 
And we've done this with big ideas in the past: drones for humanitarian work with UNICEF, blockchain for journalism, on-device machine learning for recommendations, and privacy projects far ahead of their time.
We're here to hold space for your complicated tech/business/people problems with warmth, precision and integrity. 

### Think of it as the feeling you get when someone has your back and *tells the truth*. 



### A lot is at stake. Building something new is brave. Let's build the horizon together. 

Interests include: Agtech, biotech, mental health innovations, 5G, infrastructure, climate change resilience, psilocybin/MDMA/ketamine startups,
