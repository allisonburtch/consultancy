title: Hey. Welcome.

### [name] is a strategy and research consultancy that provides expert-level feedback on technical products in an aim to serve the common good.

Startups start with a wild/terrible/genius/boring idea and the will to make it happen. You have a vision for a different world, how your product will help people.

### We all share a common horizon.

I work with people. And ideas. But mainly people. I could say I work with startups, non profits, NGOs, but at the end of the day it's people making these companies happen. 

I will work with you to take your startup to the next level. 

It's increasingly important -- not only for thet future of the planet and humanity but for your business ietself -- to align your mission with you rproduct. Your customers want to buy something that feels good. Your employees don't want to work for someone shady. I'm not an ethicist. I believe in a productive future, that dreaming is important, and making the world a space for all of us is urgently important. I want to work with you not to change the world (which is fine on its own) but to create situations where humans can be their fullest selves. 

I'm here to partner with you to solve the problems of future productions. 

I’ve spent the years since I graduated from ITP working with NGOs, nonprofits, startups and individuals who are determined to build the future that benefits all of us. 

I’ve found that there is a big gap between what companies want to do and what they’re willing to do,???? [more. How can people connect to this story?] 


Interests: agribusiness, psilocybin/ketamine startups, mental health startups, 

too many words already!
