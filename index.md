title: Hey, welcome.

We're IRL Research Lab. We work with people. And ideas. And technology. But mainly people. 
### Humanity is on the verge of many possible futures, all happening at the same time, to all of us. 
I bring clarity that saves your organization time, energy and resources. And I've done this with big ideas in the past: drones for humanitarian work with UNICEF, blockchain for journalism, AI/ML for privacy, and a range of political work. We're here to hold space for your complicated tech/business/people problems with warmth, precision and integrity. 
### Think of it as the feeling you get when someone has your back and *tells the truth*. 
IRL Research Lab is commited to building the future. We will help you align your mission and your product, your dream with reality, so that you can be fully grounded in your own integrity as you bravely build the future. 
### A lot is at stake. Building something new is brave. Let's build the horizon together.
