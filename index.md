## We’re IRL Research Lab.
<br>
### We believe that humanity is on the verge of many possible futures.

### We help teams of people build inspiring products.

### We thrive on the difficult and have the range to hold space for complicated projects. 

<br>
<br><br>
We align your mission and your product, your dream with reality, so that you can be fully grounded in your own integrity as you plan and build. 

## Here's how:

We **conduct research** to predict possible futures

We **analyze** your company’s product and mission alignment.

We **build tech roadmaps** to fix and maintain alignment.

**But mostly, we have your back, and tell the truth.**

**[And we’ve done this with big ideas in the past](/services):** drones for humanitarian work, on-device machine learning for recommendations, blockchain for journalism and privacy hardware far ahead of its time. 

**Building something new is brave. Let's build the horizon together.**
