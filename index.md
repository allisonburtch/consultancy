title: Hey. Welcome.

building something new is brave. building something new that is an affront to the status quo is braver. and building something new that is xxx can be downright insane.

i will tell you the truth and help you work through the muddled mush that is modern societal messaging. 

telling the truth is a work of beauty because it is the creation of something new.

kids in china want to be astronauts. kids in the us want to be influencers. but everywhere i go (outside of bourgie ass nyc) people praise elon musk. i think that's becuase he's actually building the future. and people wat a part of it.

they also 

no one else ahs the critique but can also build. who has the philosophical/academic knowledge but also industry knowledge of how things work and how to make them. sophisticated, thoughtful, principled, powerful. 

i've worked on some of the most interesting and complicated projects. 

baby girl what's your dream

### [name] is a strategy and research consultancy that provides expert-level feedback on technical products in an aim to serve the common good.

Startups start with a wild/terrible/genius/boring idea and the will to make it happen. You have a vision for a different world, how your product will help people.

### We all share a common horizon.

I work with people. And ideas. But mainly people. I could say I work with startups, non profits, NGOs, but at the end of the day it's people making these companies happen. 

I will work with you to take your startup to the next level. 

It's increasingly important -- not only for the future of the planet and humanity but for your business ietself -- to align your mission with your product. Your customers want to buy something that feels good. Your employees don't want to work for someone shady. I'm not an ethicist. I believe in a productive future, that dreaming is important, and making the world a space for all of us is urgently important. I want to work with you not to change the world (which is fine on its own) but to create situations where humans can be their fullest selves. 

// put the range of contrasts
// kind of a thought leader

I'm here to partner with you to solve the problems of future productions. 

I’ve spent the years since I graduated from ITP working with NGOs, nonprofits, startups and individuals who are determined to build the future that benefits all of us. 

I’ve found that there is a big gap between what companies want to do and what they’re willing to do,???? [more. How can people connect to this story?] 

i've been in this for a while, the people who have feels about how the world should be but dont' know how to enact that. that's a powerful thing to be able to say that i can bring this to the table. maintain princple through execution 

principled person, rare, hard for organizations to find pricipled people who are willing to help guide them

Interests: agribusiness, psilocybin/ketamine startups, mental health startups,  

too many words already!

organized stuff, have done stuff before its time, doing a specific thing, been doing it for a while, am a respected member of people who do this, have put in a lot of work/effort, active force, helped drive these conversations, so and so will tell you that they're interested in it, i've been at the forefront of the conversation when it wasn't safe to do so. i say things when they're hard to say but they end up coming true. i'm willing to say things when it's not popular, when it's not easy, but i'm usually right. 

shape of work and interests, i've been in these areas before but i'm also looking at the forefront of stuff and want to look at xyz,
