# Canopy is a privacy startup located in Brooklyn.

Canopy is a new personalization engine for a better internet. Canopy has built a private, explainable and controllable architecture that gives you the power of discovery while keeping your data secure. Canopy combines on-device machine learning and differential privacy to ensure no personal data leaves your device. 


> *"We had a lot of ideas and many directions we could go in. Allison [brought clarity](https://canopy.cr/post/why-is-big-tech-pivoting-on-privacy) to the possibilities of our vision and pushed us on the fundamental questions of what we're doing. We care about privacy and algorithmic recommendations and we got clear on how that is reflected in the products we build. We also realized that there are things we don't care about, and we were able to get clear on being okay with that as well, which added a ton of value. Through her in-depth research, [strategic analysis](https://canopy.cr/post/how-we-think-about-strategy-at-canopy), [product contributions](https://canopy.cr/post/how-tonic-is-experimenting-with-reader-vibes), and network, we came out with a clear strategy, a product roadmap, and a deeper understanding of possibilities and limitations of tech."*

# UNICEF Office of Innovation

The Office of Innovation is a creative, interactive and agile team in UNICEF, which is in over 180 countries globally. The Office of Innovation at the NYHQ sits at a unique intersection, helping an organization working on huge global issues with startup thinking, technology and partners to turn new ideas into scalable solutions. 

> *"As the Speculative Hardware lead for UNICEF Innovation, Allison met with key government officials, UN stakeholders, industry leaders, and students to help negotiate the first-of-its kind drone testing corridor for humanitarian and development testing of UAVs in Malawi. She helped bring a consensus together on the use of drones for vaccine delivery and flood response, far ahead of its time. Allison understood the international tech landscape and how to strategically use power to accomplish the UN innovation goals. She advised the UNICEF Venture fund on key UAV investments."*

# Cooperation Jackson 
Cooperation Jackson is an organization founded in an attempt to develop an economically uplifting democratic “solidarity economy” in Jackson, Mississippi. Its aims are to develop a series of independent cooperatives which can empower residents of Jackson, especially those who are poor, unemployed, black, or Latino.

> *"Allison came to Jackson with a unique capacity to deeply and quickly understand our technical, political and social situation. She contributed to the framework to build the Fabrication Lab, 6-figure grants we successfully got, and advised on how to build our technical capacity with schools and institutions. We had a lot of timely discussions on what to build and what not to build regarding blockchain, software development and digital fabrication. We’re really glad we worked with her. We’d recommend her to any institution that needs a big-picture technical thinker but also someone who understands humans with deep empathy."* 
> - Kali Akuno, Executive Director of Cooperation Jackson


# AINow/Google Walkouts
Meredith Whittaker and I first met when she asked me to speak at a privacy event at Pioneer Works in 2014. Since then, we've collaborated on strategy for her multiple projects involving the future of artificial intelligence and the limits of machine learning at the [AINowInstitute](ainowinstitute.org/). 

> *"Allison is the ultimate BS detector. She’s been in and around the technology industry for over a decade...I worked at Google for over a decade, and inside and out, I’ve rarely met someone who is able to get to the heart of a technical issue with as much clarity and precision. I wished she’d been in many of the meetings where bad projects based on incomplete thinking were pushed forward."*
