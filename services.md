### **If you’re a startup founder/CEO:**

### You’re highly driven and chasing after a brilliant idea. But making that brilliant idea into a reality is the next step. 

And you’ve promised a lot -- to your investors, your employees, yourself. You're a pre-seed or seed stage startup and want to tackle this problem as soon as possible, because everything rides on it. 

### What we offer:
 - Audit comprised of interviews with yourself and team 
 - Presentation with tangible steps to move you more toward mission alignment
 - Cultural observations/ethnographies to market-based decision making

### **If you’re at a non profit/NGO starting a tech project:** 

### You believe in the deep mission of your project and also know that your organization needs to prepare itself for the tech economy and automation. 

You want to move your organization forward to be better prepared to handle what is coming next but don’t know how (or do, but need some help). 

### What we offer:
 - Audit comprised of interviews with yourself and team 
 - Product proposal and roadmap
 - Design thinking presentation

### **You’re a startup accelerator running a fund:**

### You need a consultant to send to your startups to help them with their idea and product/market/fit. You have a lot of access to capital and you want to give it to the right startups. You want to develop a research track of a future area of investment.  

### What we offer:
 - Holding projection meetings with key stakeholders
 - Broad research of selected topics
 - Narrative summary and presentation of research

### **If you’re none of these??**

You understand what it's like to have big dreams and feel like you don't really fit in anywhere. You're excited by the things we can build and maybe a little scared about the implications. Or you just want to chat!
