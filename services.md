*talk to MRB about this on thursday, and how to anticipate pricing it*

will make a structure for doing an audit

1. identify problems. 

2. honest feedback

3. help you align what you want to make (your integrity etc) and what is this product that you want to put out in the world 

'audit'is a really vague term. we 'evaluate' it. which types of audits would be permissible?
that requires a bit more specificity  

wholistic

in depth 1 on 1 interviews and consultations with founders and staff
develop survey and methodoliges to better understand the issues with organization/business planm
help facilitate  conversations with stakeholders "people involved" to insure all people that the people are figureing it out
draft reports and assessments
can be contracted to do targeted research to help inform decision making
commit to serve as a resource and a thought partner throughout the process



what is their theory of change, if they're successful how will the world change?
strategic plans and product development
enumerate this

need to do: write out each persona

You're at a non-profit and building a tech project:


You're a CEO:


You run a venture fund:


You want to start a new project:





when you're starting a new thing, call me. 

persona: what problems do they have and how do they solve them?

deliverable options:
