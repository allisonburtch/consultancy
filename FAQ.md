### What does IRL research lab stand for?

Drawing from a [long line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym) of recursive acronyms, IRL stands for IRL Research Lab.


### Who is IRL Research Lab?

IRL Research Lab was started by [Allison Burtch](https://allisonburtch.github.io/). I have a wide network of brilliant and talented collaborators, and in the following year I plan to publish some research reports with colleagues. Please be in touch if you'd like to work together. 

### How'd you get the [@irl](https://twitter.com/irl) twitter handle?

Very carefully :) Feel free to give us a [follow](https://twitter.com/irl).

<!-- ### Some writing examples?

 I recently wrote a couple pieces for Canopy: 
 - Intro to the work and [how we think about strategy](https://canopy.cr/post/how-we-think-about-strategy-at-canopy). 
 - When most privacy advocates speak about our individualistm, how to think about [machine learning, privacy and our interconnection](https://canopy.cr/post/why-is-big-tech-pivoting-on-privacy). -->


### How'd you make this website?
This site was made using [Ruby Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), modifying the [Noir](https://github.com/essentialenemy/noir/) theme and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Shout out to all the open-sourcers out there.
