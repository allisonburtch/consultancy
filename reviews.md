### **[Canopy](canopy.cr/)** is a privacy startup located in Brooklyn that combines on-device machine learning and differential privacy to ensure no personal data leaves your device. 

*"We had a lot of ideas and many directions we could go in. Allison [brought clarity](https://canopy.cr/post/why-is-big-tech-pivoting-on-privacy) to the possibilities of our vision and pushed us on the fundamental questions of what we're doing, and we got clear on how that is reflected in the products we build. Through her in-depth research, [strategic analysis](https://canopy.cr/post/how-we-think-about-strategy-at-canopy), [product contributions](https://canopy.cr/post/how-tonic-is-experimenting-with-reader-vibes), and network, we came out with a clear strategy, a product roadmap, and a deeper understanding of possibilities and limitations of what we're building."* <br>-Brian Whitman, Founder and CEO of Canopy

### **[UNICEF Office of Innovation](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/)** takes emerging technological tools and tests how they can be applied to benefit the world's most vulnerable women and children. If successful, we scale those technologies to positively impact children around the world.

*"As the Speculative Hardware lead for UNICEF Innovation, Allison met with key government officials, UN stakeholders, industry leaders, and students to help negotiate the first-of-its kind drone testing corridor for humanitarian and development testing of UAVs in Malawi. She helped bring a consensus together on the use of drones for vaccine delivery and flood response, far ahead of its time. Allison understood the international tech landscape and how to strategically use power to accomplish the UN innovation goals. She advised the UNICEF Venture fund on key UAV investments."* <br>- Chris Fabian, co-founder of UNICEF Innovation and Venture Fund

### **[Cooperation Jackson](https://cooperationjackson.org/)** is an organization founded in an attempt to develop an economically uplifting democratic “solidarity economy" in Jackson, Mississippi. Its aims are to develop a series of independent cooperatives which can empower residents of Jackson, especially those who are poor, unemployed, black, or Latino.

*"Allison came to Jackson with a unique capacity to deeply and quickly understand our technical, political and social situation. She contributed to the framework to build the Fabrication Lab, 6-figure grants we successfully got, and advised on how to build our technical capacity with schools and institutions. We had a lot of timely discussions on what to build and what not to build regarding blockchain, software development and digital fabrication. We’re really glad we worked with her. We’d recommend her to any institution that needs a big-picture technical thinker but also someone who understands humans with deep empathy."* <br>- Kali Akuno, Executive Director of Cooperation Jackson

### **[AI Now](https://ainowinstitute.org/)** is a research institute examining the social implications of artificial intelligence. [Meredith Whittaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Whittaker) and I first collaborated when she asked me to speak about privacy in 2014. Since then, we've worked on strategy for her multiple projects involving the future of artificial intelligence, support for her anti-Maven letter at Google and the Google walkouts that sparked protests in tech globally. 
*"Allison is the ultimate BS detector. She’s been in and around the technology industry for over a decade...I worked at Google for over a decade, and inside and out, I’ve rarely met someone who is able to get to the heart of a technical issue with as much clarity and precision. I wished she’d been in many of the meetings where bad projects based on incomplete thinking were pushed forward."* <br>- Meredith Whitacker, Co-Founder of AINow
