### What is IRL research lab?

Drawing from a long line of recursive naming, IRL stands for IRL Research Lab.

We are feeling you get when someone has your back and tells the truth. 

We're a research lab for the future. We work with you to solve tricky problems, publish trends, and report on findings from our unique perspective. 


### How'd you get the @irl twitter handle?

Very carefully :) 

Please follow us [here](https://twitter.com/irl).

<!-- ### Some writing examples?

 I recently wrote a couple pieces for Canopy: 
 - Intro to the work and [how we think about strategy](https://canopy.cr/post/how-we-think-about-strategy-at-canopy). 
 - When most privacy advocates speak about our individualistm, how to think about [machine learning, privacy and our interconnection](https://canopy.cr/post/why-is-big-tech-pivoting-on-privacy). -->


### Can I get a longass third-person bio please?

IRL Research Lab was founded by [Allison Burtch](allisonburtch.github.io/). The name Allison means "truthful one" and that has been her life's mission - to create beauty and tell the truth so that we can live more freely on this interconnected planet. She has consulted since 2014 for startups, community groups and NGOs. 

She has worn many hats, and has been a strategist, technologist and researcher, most recently at [Canopy](https://canopy.cr/post/why-is-big-tech-pivoting-on-privacy) -- a Brooklyn-based startup creating a private recommendation architecture for the internet. Previously, she was the Speculative Hardware lead at UNICEF, creating the [global strategy](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/drone-use-humanitarian-aid) for drone delivery of vaccines and flood response. 

After seeing how techno-utopian much of the creative tech field was, she made the first “Critical Theory of Technology: Politics, Utopia and Code” at the [School for Poetic Computation](https://allisonburtch.github.io/sfpc/) in 2014. She was a resident at Eyebeam where she created a [small ultrasonic hardware device](https://allisonburtch.github.io/mic-jammer/) that protects smart phone users from passive audio surveillance. People thought she was crazy at the time but _la historia me absolverá_. An [anti-genetic surveillance video](https://allisonburtch.github.io/dna-spoofing/) Allison made with friends has been shown at every Holocaust museum in Europe. 

She loves collaborating on projects, and has helped make the [Dumb Store](https://web.archive.org/web/20170712083832/http://www.dumbsto.re/)– a mobile app store for dumbphones, co-organized [Prism BreakUp](http://prismbreakup.org/) at Eyebeam and the [Drones and Aerial Robotics Conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20131221051928/http://droneconference.org/) at New York University. In 2011-2012, Allison was an editor of the [Occupied Wall Street Journal](https://allisonburtch.github.io/owsj/), a six-edition print publication which was translated into six languages and distributed globally. She led a European biking and camping tour for teenagers, traveled by train from Kazakhstan to Beijing and lived on a boat. She has spoken internationally at conferences and universities. She has a master’s degree from New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program.
