### What is ibeona research lab (irl)?

_ibeona_ is a word based on the Greek goddess of outward journeys, baby steps and new beginnings. 

I like to think that _ibeona_ is the feeling you get when someone has your back and tells the truth. 

We're a research lab for the future. We work with you to solve tricky problems, publish trends, and report on findings from our unique perspective. 


### How'd you get the @irl twitter handle?

Very carefully :)

### Some writing examples?

 I recently wrote a couple pieces for Canopy: 
 - Intro to the work and [how we think about strategy](https://canopy.cr/post/how-we-think-about-strategy-at-canopy). 
 - When most privacy advocates speak about our individualistm, how to think about [machine learning, privacy and our interconnection](https://canopy.cr/post/why-is-big-tech-pivoting-on-privacy).


### Can I get a longass bio please?
