### What is ibeona research lab (irl)?

_ibeona_ is a word based on the greek goddess of outward journeys, baby steps and new beginnings. I like to think that _ibeona_ is the feeling you get when someone has your back and tells the truth. 

We're a research lab. We work with you to solve tricky problems, publish trends, and report on our findings from a unique perspective.
