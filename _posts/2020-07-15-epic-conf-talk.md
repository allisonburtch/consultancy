You know how when you read books as a kid, about princesses or wizards or superheroes, so many of those books had a premise of an unloved child transformed by the unveiling of their uniqueness? A poor, sad girl turns out to be a princess, a weird nerdy boy  turns out to have magical wizard powers, a strange child sings songs that conjure the almighty.

As we get older, it turns out....while we're all unique, we're not as special as we would have _preferred_ to be, in fact we're just normal people, like everyone else! But the flip-side is also a gift. Those special powers don't need to be special; we can access the resilience, kindness, love, and forthrightness from within and give that to others.

This talk is about moving into the unknown, specifically regarding quarantine. While a lot has changed since I gave it at the end of May, I still think the premise holds true: you have what it takes. 

I've spent years reading about utopias, about the hope that a new technology, a new political movement, a new society will radically transform everything. I used to believe in saviors, but now I believe there's only us. 

Hope you enjoy.
