I announced this consultancy in the middle of February, at the beginning of coronavirus and promptly got paralyzed by fear. Was this a dumb move? Brave? Perhaps a mixture of both? How can I reach out to people during this time? People are getting laid off. Budgets are getting cut. I felt completely frozen. 

So like millions of people, my business took a hit when coronavirus started. The Paycheck Protection Program was designed for people with small businesses, including independent contractors. Last year while consulting I was mostly 1099-MISCs, and so I was elible for PPP. 

But anyone trying to get PPP will know that the hardest part is finding a bank to file your application. Banks are incentivized to help out the people who want millions of dollars, and I was applying for less than $15k. 

Now listen, I'm not gonna lie. I'm a little bit of a hustler. If there was a way to get this figured out, I was gonna do it. I've also been a huge supporter of credit unions sincle Wells Fargo fucked me over too many times to count. So I already had a personal account at the [Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union](https://lespeoples.org/), with an added benefit of getting a [CitiBike discount](https://www.citibikenyc.com/pricing/cdcu) in NYC. 

**Here's what I did the first week of April:**
- filed my 2019 taxes
- got an LLC 
- got an EIN
- applied for a small business bank account immediately with the LESPFCU
- asked to file PPP with the credit union, as I had already been a personal member

**April 10th:**

I applied with the [LESFPCU](https://lespeoples.org/) and didn't hear back for a couple days. I called them every day. They told me not to apply anywhere else. At this point, I was majorly stressing. Should I apply with some of the fintech startups that said they were taking applications? I was already looking into Fundera and BlueVine.


**April 16th:**

The worst thing happened -- the SBA ran out of money. I had called the LESFPCU every single day. I was devastated.


**April 20th:**

I regretted just trusting the credit union. I was getting emails from [Fundera](https://www.fundera.com/), and they wrote on their website that you can apply with many lenders, because the SBA's E-TRAN system will only take one application per person/SSN. After getting that information, I applied for PPP with every possible fintech startup that was taking applications: Fundera, [Cross River Bank](https://funderaapply.crossriversba.com/), Kabbage, [BlueVine](https://www.bluevine.com/), Paypal, Square and [TCF](https://www.tcfbank.com/). Some of them emailed me back, asking for more information.



**April 27th**

Congress approved more money for the SBA, with $30 billiion going to community lenders, small banks and credit unions. I called the LESPFCU (yes you could actually talk to a human person). They said it was looking like my application would be approved. 


**April 30th:**

LESFPCU emailed me to tell me my loan was approved! I literally danced in my apt. They sent out an email last week. It turns out they only processed 30 small business applications (!!!!) and have stopped taking applications.

I cancelled all my other applications with the fintech startups, but I have no idea if any of them would have ultimately gone through. I'm insanely grateful that I was able to get PPP, and I feel for anyone who has struggled to get it. Utlimately, independent contractors were left to fend for themselves. They are in this middle ground between PPP and unemployment.
