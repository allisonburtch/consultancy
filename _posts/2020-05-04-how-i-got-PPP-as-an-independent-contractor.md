I announced this consultancy in the middle of February, at the beginning of coronavirus and got promptly paralyzed by fear. Was this a dumb move? Brave? Perhaps a mixture of both? How can I reach out to people during this time? People are getting laid off. Budgets are getting cut. 

So like millions of people, my business took a hit when coronavirus started. Luckily, the Paycheck Protection Program was designed for people with small businesses, including independent contractors. Last year while consulting I was mostly 1099-MISCs, and so I was eligible for PPP. 

**This is a post describing all of the Kaftaesque hurdles I had to jump over in order to get PPP.**

Anyone trying to get PPP will know that the hardest part is _finding_ a bank to file your application. Banks are incentivized to help out the people who want millions of dollars, and I was applying for less than $15k. 

Now listen, I'm not gonna lie - I'm a little bit of a hustler. If there was a way to get this figured out, I was gonna do it. I've supported credit unions sincle Wells Fargo fucked me over too many times to count, so I already had a personal account at the [Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union](https://lespeoples.org/), which had an added benefit of getting a [CitiBike discount](https://www.citibikenyc.com/pricing/cdcu) in NYC. 

But I had a lot of work to do, in a very short amount of time. 

**Here's what I did the first week of April:**
- filed my 2019 taxes
- got an LLC in NY State
- fulfilled the NY State publishing requirement for LLCs
- got an EIN
- applied for a small business bank account immediately with the LESPFCU, as I had already been a personal member
- asked to file PPP with the credit union, and even though I was a new business account, they still let me

**April 10th:**

I applied with the [LESFPCU](https://lespeoples.org/) and didn't hear back. I called them every day. They told me not to apply anywhere else. At this point, I was majorly stressing. Should I apply with some of the fintech startups that said they were taking applications? I was already looking into Fundera and BlueVine.


**April 16th:**

The worst thing happened -- the SBA ran out of money. I had called the LESFPCU every single day. I was devastated.


**April 20th:**

I regretted just trusting the credit union. [Fundera](https://www.fundera.com/) announced on their website that you can apply with many lenders, because the SBA's E-TRAN system will only take one application per person/SSN. After getting that information, I applied for PPP with every possible fintech startup that was taking applications: Fundera, [Cross River Bank](https://funderaapply.crossriversba.com/), Kabbage, [BlueVine](https://www.bluevine.com/), Paypal, Square and [TCF](https://www.tcfbank.com/). Some of them emailed me back, asking for more information. I still felt completely frozen.



**April 27th**

Congress approved more money for the SBA, with $30 billiion going to community lenders, small banks and credit unions. I called the LESPFCU (yes you could actually talk to a human person). They said it was looking like my application would be approved. I started to feel some hope.


**April 30th:**

LESFPCU emailed me to tell me my loan was approved! I literally danced in my apt. They sent out an email last week. It turns out they only processed 30 small business applications (!!!!) and have stopped taking applications.

I cancelled all my other applications with the fintech startups, but I have no idea if any of them would have ultimately gone through. 

Ultimately, independent contractors were left to fend for themselves. Independent contractors make up [36% of the workforce nationally](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-paychex-data-shows-independent-contractor-growth-outpaces-employee-hiring-in-small-businesses-300775712.html), but in metro areas that is much higher. They are in this middle ground between PPP and unemployment.

I'm insanely grateful that I was able to get PPP, and I feel for anyone who has struggled to get it.
