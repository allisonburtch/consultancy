Hi, thanks for visiting. Consider this the 'hello, world' post for IRL Research Lab. Launching a consultancy in the middle of a global pandemic is perhaps the opposite of the ideal situation that I was imagining, which was that I'd send this to all my friends and we could be excited and I'd get to talk to tons of people. But I've gotten over that. We do not live in an ideal world. 

We're facing one of the biggest crises that this generation has experienced. I will leave the sociological writings to the sociologists.

But what is going on? HOw are we going to weather COVID-19. I don't have all the answers though i like to think i do or that i could figure it out. 


I'm starting this research lab because I have a unique capacity to hold a wide range of space for people who are building the future for all of us. I've worked on some really complicated projects. I understand the stakes. 
I'm considering this a soft launch and am going to be holding two webinars:

This Friday, March 20th: how to work from home

The funny thing about this quarantine is that I'm available to start working immediately, and can do so. I'd love to be in touch. 


what a world we are living in right now? People are responding to this crisis like people respond to all bad things that happen: with denial, grief, control and fear -- but also with generosity, compassion, acceptance, and clarity. 

This is not an ideal situation. I hesitated to write this, to launch this, but i wanted to say a couple things. 

This is a time for us to come together and acknowledge some truths: that sometimes things happen that are not ideal, that we are not in control, and t

Hey welcome and thanks for visiting. 8

NOw is the time to do a couple things:

1. Manage our anxiety

2. Rest if you need to

3. Build if you can
